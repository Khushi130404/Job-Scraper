Each video will combine technical illustrations, basic diagrams, and animation effects with a voiceover. The voiceover will explain concepts, and the animations will visually support the content being discussed.

•⁠  ⁠Representation of servers: A close-up or simplified diagram of how servers look and store data.
•⁠  ⁠Challenges of on-prem architecture: Illustrations that represent challenges like high costs, limited scalability, and maintenance (e.g., a server with a price tag, growing storage problems, and IT staff fixing servers).

This first animation will be used as the foundation for the rest of the series, so it’s important to set the tone and visual style.

What I’m Looking For:

•⁠  ⁠Experience: Previous experience creating educational or explainer videos, especially on tech-related topics.
•⁠  ⁠Platform Knowledge: Familiarity with the types of animations that perform well on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube (especially short-form, engaging content).
•⁠  ⁠Style: Ability to create clean, simple, and professional animations that appeal to a young audience. We want something that feels modern, fun, and informative.
•⁠  ⁠Communication: You should be comfortable collaborating on visual ideas and iterating based on feedback.

Requirements:

•⁠  ⁠1-minute animations for each episode (ongoing series).
•⁠  ⁠Illustrations that match the educational content being voiced over.
•⁠  ⁠Must be delivered in formats suitable for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
•⁠  ⁠Open to creating templates or reusable assets for future videos (optional but a plus).

Deliverables:

•⁠  ⁠Animations in .mp4 format optimized for social media platforms.
•⁠  ⁠Files in various resolutions: 1080x1080 (Instagram), 1080x1920 (TikTok), and 1920x1080 (YouTube).
•⁠  ⁠A consistent visual style across all episodes.

Budget: Please provide your rate per 1-minute animation. I am looking for a long-term collaboration, as this will be an ongoing series with weekly or bi-weekly episodes.

To Apply:

•⁠  ⁠Please provide examples of your previous animation work, especially educational or tech-related content.

The animations will be used on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.

Each video will combine technical illustrations, basic diagrams, and animation effects with a voiceover. The voiceover will explain concepts, and the animations will visually support the content being discussed.

Project Overview:

We are creating a series to help introduce and explain cloud computing in simple terms. The series starts by explaining traditional on-premise architectures and gradually transitions into cloud computing concepts. Each episode will be 1-minute long, and we’ll focus on making these short clips visually engaging for social media.

Example of First Video: ""On-Premise Architecture""

In the first episode, we will explain what on-premise architecture is and how it worked before the rise of cloud computing. The animation should include:

•⁠  ⁠Illustrations of a physical office/data center: Show a big room with racks of servers.
•⁠  ⁠Representation of servers: A close-up or simplified diagram of how servers look and store data.
•⁠  ⁠Challenges of on-prem architecture: Illustrations that represent challenges like high costs, limited scalability, and maintenance (e.g., a server with a price tag, growing storage problems, and IT staff fixing servers).

This first animation will be used as the foundation for the rest of the series, so it’s important to set the tone and visual style.

What I’m Looking For:

•⁠  ⁠Experience: Previous experience creating educational or explainer videos, especially on tech-related topics.
•⁠  ⁠Platform Knowledge: Familiarity with the types of animations that perform well on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube (especially short-form, engaging content).
•⁠  ⁠Style: Ability to create clean, simple, and professional animations that appeal to a young audience. We want something that feels modern, fun, and informative.
•⁠  ⁠Communication: You should be comfortable collaborating on visual ideas and iterating based on feedback.

Requirements:

•⁠  ⁠1-minute animations for each episode (ongoing series).
•⁠  ⁠Illustrations that match the educational content being voiced over.
•⁠  ⁠Must be delivered in formats suitable for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
•⁠  ⁠Open to creating templates or reusable assets for future videos (optional but a plus).

Deliverables:

•⁠  ⁠Animations in .mp4 format optimized for social media platforms.
•⁠  ⁠Files in various resolutions: 1080x1080 (Instagram), 1080x1920 (TikTok), and 1920x1080 (YouTube).
•⁠  ⁠A consistent visual style across all episodes.

Budget: Please provide your rate per 1-minute animation. I am looking for a long-term collaboration, as this will be an ongoing series with weekly or bi-weekly episodes.

To Apply:

•⁠  ⁠Please provide examples of your previous animation work, especially educational or tech-related content.
•⁠  ⁠Include your availability and estimated turnaround time for a 1-minute video.

Looking forward to working with a creative professional who can bring these tech concepts to life in an engaging way!"

The animations will be used on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.

Each video will combine technical illustrations, basic diagrams, and animation effects with a voiceover. The voiceover will explain concepts, and the animations will visually support the content being discussed.

Project Overview:

We are creating a series to help introduce and explain cloud computing in simple terms.

Each episode will be 1-minute long, and we’ll focus on making these short clips visually engaging for social media.

In the first episode, we will explain what on-premise architecture is and how it worked before the rise of cloud computing. The animation should include:

•⁠  ⁠Illustrations of a physical office/data center: Show a big room with racks of servers.
•⁠  ⁠Representation of servers: A close-up or simplified diagram of how servers look and store data.
•⁠  ⁠Challenges of on-prem architecture: Illustrations that represent challenges like high costs, limited scalability, and maintenance (e.g., a server with a price tag, growing storage problems, and IT staff fixing servers).

This first animation will be used as the foundation for the rest of the series, so it’s important to set the tone and visual style.

What I’m Looking For:

•⁠  ⁠Experience: Previous experience creating educational or explainer videos, especially on tech-related topics.
•⁠  ⁠Platform Knowledge: Familiarity with the types of animations that perform well on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube (especially short-form, engaging content).
•⁠  ⁠Style: Ability to create clean, simple, and professional animations that appeal to a young audience. We want something that feels modern, fun, and informative.
•⁠  ⁠Communication: You should be comfortable collaborating on visual ideas and iterating based on feedback.

Requirements:

•⁠  ⁠1-minute animations for each episode (ongoing series).
•⁠  ⁠Illustrations that match the educational content being voiced over.
•⁠  ⁠Must be delivered in formats suitable for Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
•⁠  ⁠Open to creating templates or reusable assets for future videos (optional but a plus).

Deliverables:

•⁠  ⁠Animations in .mp4 format optimized for social media platforms.
•⁠  ⁠Files in various resolutions: 1080x1080 (Instagram), 1080x1920 (TikTok), and 1920x1080 (YouTube).
•⁠  ⁠A consistent visual style across all episodes.

Budget: Please provide your rate per 1-minute animation. I am looking for a long-term collaboration, as this will be an ongoing series with weekly or bi-weekly episodes.

To Apply:

•⁠  ⁠Please provide examples of your previous animation work, especially educational or tech-related content.
•⁠  ⁠Include your availability and estimated turnaround time for a 1-minute video.

Looking forward to working with a creative professional who can bring these tech concepts to life in an engaging way!"
