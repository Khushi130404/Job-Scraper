AI autonomous agent builder to automate general administrative tasks,No Employer Name Available,€12-18 EUR / hour,2 proposals,"Barcelona,  Spain","Looking for an AI Specialist for Automation Projects

Hello,

We are currently seeking an AI specialist experienced in working with systems like n8n (specifically the autonomous agent feature of [login to view URL]), Voiceflow, AgentX, or similar platforms. Our goal is to implement various automation solutions for our company, and we are particularly interested in systems capable of handling complex, generalist tasks.

One key example is creating a system that, when given a general instruction—such as ""search for the top 15 insurance agencies in Europe and request quotes""—can independently break down tasks, access websites, send emails, request quotes, wait for responses, analyze incoming quotes, and generate a report. Essentially, the system should act as a virtual administrative assistant.

We have experimented with systems like Multion, but have not yet found one efficient enough to manage the full workflow autonomously. We are keen to hear about your experience with similar systems, any recommendations you might have, and your estimated cost for both consulting and potential development of a generalist system.

Looking forward to your insights and proposal."

Flow Chart & Specs for Conveying System,No Employer Name Available,₹1500-12500 INR,2 proposals,"Delhi,  India","We want to design conveying system for plastics granules and plastics regrind with some dust particles 
1. *Stage 1 Overview (for reference)*:  
   - 4 silos with a capacity of 10 tons each.  
   - 3 silos will be loaded via a vacuum system with a single root pump and one loading station. Suction pipes will be manually connected to the loader bin for each silo.  PLEASE NOTE - We want to load different materials in different silos 

Distance from Loading station to Silo = Vertical 8 mtr and Horizontal 12 mtr . Total 20 mtr 


   - The 4th silo will store regrind flakes and will be filled via gravity.  ( this will be filled from first floor ) . Please note that these regrind flakes have dust particles - I am attaching its pictures for reference separately 

2. *Stage 2 – Material Transfer to Mixers*:  

   *Mixers Setup*:  
   - There are 6 mixers planned for the system.
   - Currently, only 2 mixers are active, while 4 additional mixers will be added in the future.

The two mixers which we currently want to feed are at a total distance of 16 mtr - which is as 12 mtr horizontal and 4 mtr vertical 
Capacity needed for 2 machines are - 500 kg per hour and 200 kg per hour

   - *Storage Bins under Silos*:  
     - Under each of the 4 silos, a *storage bin (open hopper)* will be placed, each equipped with load cells to measure the material weight.

   - Each storage bin (open hopper) will have 6 outlets underneath to accommodate future expansion, as there will eventually be 6 mixers.

   *Material Transfer to Mixers*:  
   - The 4 storage bins will be connected to a common single pipe via one of their outlets.
   - The worker will manually turn on the vacuum pump, and the material from the 4 storage bins (as per the recipe) will be conveyed to one of the mixers through this single pipe.
